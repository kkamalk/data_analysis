It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n","    doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n","    the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\n","    analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\n","    its way toward this goal.\n","    \n","    Main Features\n","    -------------\n","    Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n","    \n","      - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\n","        point data.\n","      - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\n","        higher dimensional objects\n","      - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\n","        to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\n","        `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n","        computations.\n","      - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n","        operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\n","      - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n","        and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\n","      - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\n","        data sets.\n","      - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n","      - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n","      - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\n","      - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\n","        Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n","        format.\n","      - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\n","        conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.\n","\n","PACKAGE CONTENTS\n","    _config (package)\n","    _libs (package)\n","    _testing (package)\n","
